# My post-Epicodus plan

1. Thoroughly review basic Angular principles, including two-way data binding, subscriptions, and promises. Gain a better basic understanding of the building blocks of Angular and how it works with a "backend," including FireBase. Understand weather SQL could be used instead, and why.

2. Write an Angular front-end on my capstone project (student scheduler). If scheduling is part of the app, learn how to create a "drag-and-drop" scheduling application using Angular.

3. Maintain and create new relationships with members of the tech community by using LinkedIn to send a message to at least 3 techies per day, and attending no less than 2 meetups per week.

4. Maintain a DAILY routine of writing code of my own. Every day, I will write or work on an application in some way, such as adding features to my capstone project, creating new problems to solve and working to solve them.

5. Continuously review GitHub for open-source software to work on. Spend time on open source software in different languages and frameworks, such as PHP, NodeJs, Angular, React, Ruby/Rails, Python, etc.

6. Learn PHP frameworks, such as Laravel, Symfony, CodeIgniter, CakePHP, and Zend. Relate what I've learned about Ruby on Rails to PHP.

7. Learn about Content Management Systems, and how to integrate them into an app, or if they should be integrated into an app. Explore Radiant CMS, Adva CMS, Drupal for PHP, and check out WordPress customization.

8. Continuously seek mentorship in the community by reaching out to people who "have what I want." Maintain relationships with these people, take them to coffee, and ask to write code with them.
