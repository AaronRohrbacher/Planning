# My post-Epicodus plan

1. Thoroughly review basic Angular principles, including two-way data binding, subscriptions, and promises. Gain a better basic understanding of the building blocks of Angular and how it works with a "backend," including FireBase. Understand weather SQL could be used instead, and why. _Rating: 9_

2. Write an Angular front-end on my capstone project (student scheduler). If scheduling is part of the app, learn how to create a "drag-and-drop" scheduling application using Angular. _Rating: 10_

3. Maintain and create new relationships with members of the tech community by using LinkedIn to send a message to at least 3 techies per day, and attending no less than 2 meetups per week. Each month, continue attending the Rubyist meetup at NewRelic. _Rating: 10_

4. Maintain a DAILY routine of writing code of my own. Every day, I will write or work on an application in some way, such as adding features to my capstone project, creating new problems to solve and working to solve them. _Rating: 10_

5. Continuously review GitHub for open-source software to work on. Spend time on open source software in different languages and frameworks, such as PHP, NodeJs, Angular, React, Ruby/Rails, Python, etc. _Rating: 10_

6. Learn PHP frameworks, such as Laravel, Symfony, CodeIgniter, CakePHP, and Zend. Relate what I've learned about Ruby on Rails to PHP. _Rating: 8_

7. Learn about Content Management Systems, and how to integrate them into an app, or if they should be integrated into an app. Explore Radiant CMS, Adva CMS, Drupal for PHP, and check out WordPress customization. _Rating: 6_

8. Continuously seek mentorship in the community by reaching out to people who "have what I want." Maintain relationships with these people, take them to coffee, and ask to write code with them. Do this at least once per week. _Rating: 10_

9. Practice whiteboard problems daily. Use sites such as freecodecamp.com, learnhowtoprogram.com, and locate other resources for algorithmic problems to practice solving. Ask mentors to "put me on the spot" during weekly meetings. _Rating: 10_

10. At least twice per month, host or join a gettogether with fellow Epicodus alumni to write code together. Create projects to work on with a pair, and spend a day getting them going. _Rating: 8_

11. Build a brand new portfolio site, featuring my best projects, and a blog. Deploy to Heroku with a domain name. Share blog posts on LinkedIn and Twitter to show the community what I'm thinking about/WHAT I GOT. _Rating: 10_

12. Create video blogs on my website with my take on going about learning how to program for even-more-beginners than I. Videos will include an intro to relational database setup and management, using Ruby/PHP as a scripting language, RAW Ruby/PHP using RAW SQL, followed by using frameworks to simplify. _Rating: 9_

13. Seek additional critique of my resume from mentors and the community. Scope this beyond just the resume itself- LinkedIn, GitHub, website as well. _Rating: 9_

14. Post-angular study, begin studying React. Learn what it does, and why I should use it in which circumstances. Compare the use of Angular to React, and understand the differences between them. _Rating: 7_

15. Learn how to use Apache's Cordova to compile a web application (perhaps a version of my capstone) to a native mobile application. _Rating: 7_

16. Write a "hello world" application in both Xcode and Android, not using Cordova. Possibly go beyond a "hello world," and explore SDKs for features such as push notifications, and location services. _Rating: 5_

17. Remain engaged in Epicodus itself by attending alumni meetups, demo days, and just stopping in to say hello! I'm so grateful to have been able to do this. _Rating: 8_

18. Explore and understand the current world of web hosting. Answer the following questions: how are admins/developers tending to manage e-mail? Does Heroku offer an e-mail plan? How does Ruby/Rails hosting work? Can I just use things like hostgator/ other cPanel based hosting companies? _Rating: 5_

19. Read _The Well Grounded Rubyist_ (thanks for that one!) _Rating: 4_

20. Further explore the world of API authentication, with and without CORS functionality. Be able to use both Ruby/Rails and Angular to access any part of any API by exploring nodeJS backend functionality. Review the Spotify Party app we did as a group, and add the ability to login with spotify to add a playlist to a party (this was blocked by CORS limitations). _Rating: 8_

21. Maintain a calendar (perhaps write a program, or use existing software) of the daily, weekly, and monthly items in this list, beginning with the top priorities _Rating: 10_

22. Get a job, you poor hippy! _Rating: 10_

# A Summary:

The goal here is to continuously become a better programmer, in a well-rounded sense. Practice and development are daily goals, and networking and mentorship reach-out are daily, weekly, and monthly goals. I need to continue to thrive not only at getting better at programming, but at being an active part of the technology community here in Portland, and nationwide. Continuing meetups, seeking mentorship, and maintaining current relationships are as much a part of my goals as writing applications. I'm choosing web development as my career, and there is not a finish line; my education will be ongoing, and life-long.
